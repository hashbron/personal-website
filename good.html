      <h1>ABOUT</h1>
      <div class="non-fade-element">
        <p>I'm excited about politics and progressive candidates, I love listening to and talking about music, and I hate to admit I also love computer science. I hate big tech and love privacy, annoying things my friends are sick of hearing me say include "you should switch to Firefox" and "can we move this group chat to Signal?"</p>

      <div class="non-fade-element">
        <p>Most recently, I've worked on the Joe Biden for President data team in Colorado. Before that I worked on the Elizabeth Warren data team in Iowa (talk to me about caucuses! I! have! a! lot! of! thoughts!).</p>

        <p>I am a New Jersey native currently quarentining in the Garden State. I stuided computer science, with a focus on theory, at Stanford University (talk to me about Turing Machines!).</p>
